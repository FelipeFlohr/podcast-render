- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for the main script)

## FAQ

1. Why did you make this program?
- As I said in the video, my teacher gave me a homework: "folks, let's make a podcast. Band together with your friends, pick a theme and record it", but I was afraid that our voices would sound kinda similar, so I decided to do this to help him understand who is currently speaking.
2. The program is not portable
- Again, as I said in the video, the deadline of the homework is getting closer, so I decided to "rush" a bit, sacrificing some portability.
3. I just want to download the Frame Extractor
- You can download it separated from the other files in my GitHub repository.
4. "I found a bug" or "I don't know how to use this"
- You can open an issue ticket here on GitHub or reach me on my e-mail: felipeflohrlol@gmail.com
